# Interactive Learning Framework

This is an EXAMPLE working logic \& framework for the kidney stone interactive segmentation project. Got the idea from a 2015 paper and tried to refine the workflow for more flexible applications. Pay attention to the makefile to get a quick view. 

Note: The repository is not yet complete and subject to any future changes.
